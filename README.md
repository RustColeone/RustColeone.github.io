I need to learn engineering one way or another

## Purpose
This project is initiated because I wanted to simplify our engineering learning process. So we have some place to reference to. Physics and Mathematics both have a rich resource that someone can refer to, however, this is not really possible with engineering: resources are difficult to locate.
